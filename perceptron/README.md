Machine Learning contains two main components they are data and algorithm to train machine on that data. Here I am training my model to predict the multiplication table .It is a single layered perceptron where I randomize the weight which is to be made 2.I calculate the result with simple linear regression eqn y=wx then compared it with the result(aka reenforcement Learning) calculated the cost function iterating over the data and minimized it by approximating it's derivative subtracting the weight is costfunction is increasing and adding the weight if costfunction is decreasing.
